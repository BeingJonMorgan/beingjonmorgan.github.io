# State of the Summer

Okay, so it's almost August and I’m already starting to feel remorse that the summer is almost over. I’m not sure why--it’s not like I’ve ever been a huge traveller or entertainer during the Summer months. For me, the summer is the same as any other season: work, pay the bills, feed the kids. But, I do feel this pressure to take advantage of our kids’ break from school to show them some fun and memorable times. This could easily mean travel, and we’ve done a little bit of that. But, I feel like I’m not fulfilling some kind of obligation to create experiences for them.

I was wondering if anybody ever feels the same way?
